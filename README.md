# LSTM-MLP-Knowledge-Distillation-for-Indoor-Localization
Implements knowledge distillation between an LSTM teacher and an MLP student for Wi-Fi indoor localization. The LSTM captures temporal features from signal sequences, while the MLP learns from the teacher’s outputs for fast single-scan inference.
